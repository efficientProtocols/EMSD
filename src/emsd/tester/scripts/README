These test scripts are for use with the EMSD Interoperability Test Plan
document, which lists a series of tests to run.

Before running the tests, set the environment variable TEST_SESSION to
be a descriptive string identifying the test run.  This is to make sure
that the resulting e-mail can be properly associated with the session.
